    Creates an area for you to draw on.
    The MAGICAL property this Element has is that you interact
    with the element using your own coordinate system.
    This is an important point!!
    YOU define where the location is for (0,0).
    
    Want (0,0) to be in the middle of the graph like a math 4-quadrant graph?
    No problem!
    
    Set your lower left corner to be (-100,-100)
    and your upper right to be (100,100)
    and you've got yourself a graph with (0,0) at the center.
    
    One of THE coolest of the Elements.
    
    You can also use float values.
    To do so, be sure and set the `float_values` parameter.
    
    Mouse click and drag events are possible
    and return the (x,y) coordinates of the mouse
    
    Drawing primitives return an "id" that is referenced
    when you want to operation on that item (e.g. to erase it)
