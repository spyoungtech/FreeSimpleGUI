## Release Notes
2.3 - Sliders, Listbox's and Image elements (oh my!)

If using Progress Meters, avoid cancelling them when you have another window open.  It could lead to future windows being blank. It's being worked on.

New debug printing capability.  `sg.Print`

2.5 Discovered issue with scroll bar on `Output` elements.  The bar will match size of ROW not the size of the element.  Normally you never notice this due to where on a form the `Output` element goes.

Listboxes are still without scrollwheels. The mouse can drag to see more items.  The mouse scrollwheel will also scroll the list and will `page up` and `page down` keys.

2.7 Is the "feature complete" release. Pretty much all features are done and in the code

2.8 More text color controls.  The caller has more control over things like the focus and what buttons should be clicked when enter key is pressed. Return values as a dictionary! (NICE addition)

2.9 COLUMNS!  This is the biggest feature and had the biggest impact on the code base.  It was a difficult feature to add, but it was worth it.  Can now make even more layouts. Almost any layout is possible with this addition.

.................. insert releases 2.9 to 2.30 .................

3.0 We've come a long way baby!  Time for a major revision bump.  One reason is that the numbers started to confuse people  the latest release was 2.30, but some people read it as 2.3 and thought it went backwards.  I kinda messed up the 2.x series of numbers, so why not start with a clean slate.  A lot has happened anyway so it's well earned.

One change that will set PySimpleGUI apart is the parlor trick of being able to move the window by clicking on it anywhere.  This is turned on by default.  It's not a common way to interact with windows.  Normally you have to move using the titlebar.  Not so with PySimpleGUI.  Now you can drag using any part of the window.  You will want to turn off for windows with sliders.  This feature is enabled in the Window call.

Related to the Grab Anywhere feature is the no_titlebar option, again found in the call to Window.  Your window will be a spiffy, borderless window.  It's a really interesting effect.  Slight problem is that you do not have an icon on the taskbar with these types of windows, so if you don't supply a button to close the window, there's no way to close it other than task manager.

3.0.2 Still making changes to Update methods with many more ahead in the future.  Continue to mess with grab anywhere option.  Needed to disable in more places such as the PopupGetText function.  Any time these is text input on a form, you generally want to turn off the grab anywhere feature.

#### 3.2.0
 Biggest change was the addition of the Table Element.  Trying to make changes so that form resizing is a possibility but unknown if will work in the long run.  Removed all MsgBox, Get* functions and replaced with Popup functions.  Popups had multiple new parameters added to change the look and feel of a popup.

#### 3.3.0
OneLineProgressMeter function added which gives you not only a one-line solution to progress meters, but it also gives you the ability to have more than 1 running at the same time, something not possible with the EasyProgressMeterCall

#### 3.4.0

* Frame - New Element - a labelled frame for grouping elements. Similar
   to Column
* Graph (like a Canvas element except uses the caller's
   coordinate system rather than tkinter's).
* initial_folder - sets starting folder for browsing type buttons (browse for file/folder).
* Buttons return  key value rather than button text **If** a `key` is specified,
*
   OneLineProgressMeter!  Replaced EasyProgressMeter (sorry folks that's
   the way progress works sometimes)

    * Popup
    * PopupGetFolder
    * PopupGetFile
    * PopupGetText

* `DrawText` added to Graph Elements
* Removed `Window.UpdateElements`
* `Window.grab_anywere` defaults to False

* Added change_submits capability to Checkbox, Tab Group
* Combobox - Can set value to an Index into the Values table rather than the Value itself
* Warnings added to Drawing routines for Graph element (rather than crashing)
* Window - can "force top level" window to be used rather than a normal window.  Means that instead of calling Tk to get a window, will call TopLevel to get the window
* Window Disable / Enable - Disables events (button clicks, etc) for a Window.  Use this when you open a second window and want to disable the first window from doing anything. This will simulate a 'dialog box'
* Tab Group returns a value with Window is Read.  Return value is the string of the selected tab
* Turned off grab_anywhere for Popups
* New parameter, default_extension, for PopupGetFile
* Keyboard shortcuts for menu items. Can hold ALT key to select items in men

## 3.35 PySimpleGUI & 1.35 PySimpleGUI27 27-May-2019

* Bug fix - when setting default for Checkbox it was also disabling the element!


## 3.36 PySimpleGUI & 1.36 PySimpleGUI27 29-May-2019

A combination of user requests, and needs of new `imwatchingyou` debugger

* New Debugger Icon for future built-in debugger
* Fixed bug in FindBoundReturnKey - needed to also check Panes
* NEW Window functions to turn on/off the Grab Anywhere feature
    * `Window.GrabAnyWhereOn()`
    * `Window.GrabAnyWhereOff()`
* New "Debugger" button that's built-in like other buttons.  It's a TINY button with a logo. For future use when a debugger is built into PySimpleGUI itself (SOON!)
* Change Text Element Wrap Length calculation.  Went fromn +40 pixels to +10 pixels in formula
* PopupGetFile has new parameter - `multiple_files`. If True then allows selection of multiple files


## 3.37 PySimpleGUI & 1.37 PySimpleGUI27 1-June-2019

* The built-in debugger is HERE - might not WORK exactly yet, but a lot of code went into te PySimpleGUI.py file for this.  At the moment, the `imwatchingyou` package is THE way to use a PySimpleGUI debugger. But soon enough you won't need that project in order to debug your program.
* Some strange code reformatting snuck in.  There are 351 differences between this and previous release.  I'm not sure what happened but am looking at every change by hand.
* New Calendar Button features
    * locale, format - new parameters to TKCalendar call
    * Use custom icon for window if one has been set
    * New parameters to CalendarButton - `locale`, `format`
* The bulk of the built-in PySimpleGUI debugger has been added but is not yet "officially supported".  Try pressing "break" or "ctrl+break" on your keyboard.
    * New bindings for break / pause button and debugger
    * New Debug button will launch debugger.
    * New parameter `debugger_enabled` added to Window call.  Default is __enabled__.
    * Your progam's call to Read is all that's needed to refresh debugger
    * New `Window` methods to control debugger access
        * `EnableDebugger` - turns on HOTKEYS to debugger
        * `DisableDebugger` - turns off HOTKEYS to debugger
* Restored wrap len for Text elements back from +10 to +40 pixels
* `PopupGetFolder`, `PopupGetFile` - fixed so that the "hidden" master window stays hidden (a Linux problem)
* Added support for Multiple Files to `PopupGetFiles` when no_window option has been set.


## 3.38 PySimpleGUI, 1.38 PySimpleGUI27

* Multiline - now has a "read only" state if created as "Disabled"
* Multiline - If window is created as resizable, then Multiline Elements will now expand when the window is enlarged, a feature long asked for.
* Output Element expands in the Y Direction
* "Expandable Rows" option added to PackFormIntoFrame allowing future elements to also expand
* Error Element - silence_on_error option
* Text Element wrapping - FINALLY got it right?  No more "Fudge factor" added
* PopupScrolled - Windows are now resizable
* Option to "launch built-in debugger" from the test harness
* Rememeber that the Debugger is still in this code!  It may or may not be operational as it's one version back from the latest release of the `imwatchingyou` debugger code. This code needs to be integrated back in

## 3.39 PySimpleGUI & 1.39 PySimpleGUI27 13-June-2019

* Ported the imwatchingyou debugger code into PySimpleGUI code
    * Replaced old debugger built-in code with the newer imwatchingyou version
    * Required removing all of the 'sg.' before PySimpleGUI calls since not importing
    * Dynamically create the debugger object when first call to `refresh` or `show` is made
* Started the procecss of renaming Class Methods that are private to start with _
* Needed for the automatic documentation generation that's being worked on
* Fixed crash when clicking the Debug button
* Fixed bug in DeleteFigure. Needed to delete image separately
* Added more type hints
* New `TabGroup` method `SelectTab(index)` selects a `Tab` within a `TabGroup`
* New `Table.Update` parameter - `select_rows`. List of rows to select (0 is first)
* Error checking in `Window.Layout` provides error "hints" to the user
    * Looks for badly placed ']'
    * Looks for functions missing '()'
    * Pops up a window warning user instead of crashing
    * May have to revisit if the popups start getting in the way
* New implementations of `Window.Disable()` and `Window.Enable()`
    * Previously did not work correctly at all
    * Now using the "-disabled" attribute
* Allow Comboboxes to have empty starting values
    * Was crashing
    * Enables application to fill these in later

The let's kickoff 2021 release!

Custom Titlebars, Fix for Docstrings so PyCharm 2020 works correctly, New shortcuts, Window Close Attempted

* Custom Titlebar - new element
	* Initial reason was Trinket, but great feature overall
	* Allows windows to be styled to match the colors of the window
	* Automatically uses theme for colors
	* Automatically used when running on Trinket
	* Can specify using them by using set_options, a Titlebar element, or parameters in Window creation
	* Documentation is coming soonish
	* Demo exists showing how to use (it's enough that you won't need a Cookbook / detailed docs to add it to your own program)
	* Changes include adding a 16x16 pixel version of the PySimpleGUI icon
	* popups - If custom titlebar is set using set_options (and is thus globally applied) then popups will use the custom titlebar
* MASSIVE number of changes to docstrings so that PyCharm again works correctly.  All Unions had to be changed to use "|" instead
* Internal functions added to check what OS is being used rather than having os.platform checks all over thee place
* Element.Visible removed. Element.visible property returns current visibility state for element
	* This is a read-only property
* Added dummy Element.update method so that PyCharm doesn't complain about a missing method
* InputElement class changed to Input.  Both will work as InputElement is now an alias
* Fix in Spin.update.  Was using an illegal state value of "enable" rather than "normal"
* New Shortcuts for Elements
	* Sp = Spin
	* SBar = StatusBar
	* BM = ButtonMenu
	* Progress = ProgressBar
	* Im = Image
	* G = Graph
	* Fr = Frame
	* Sl = Slider
* Button - Allow button color background to be specified as None. This will cause the theme's color to be auto chosen as background
* Image.DrawArc - fill_color parameter added
* Column - update now uses the expand information so that a column will re-pack correctly when made invisible to visible. Added fill parm to pack call
* New Window parameters:
	* enable_close_attempted_event=False
    * titlebar_background_color=None
	* titlebar_text_color=None
	* titlebar_font=None
	* titlebar_icon=None
    * use_custom_titlebar=None
* Removed "Faking Timeout" print because the state that triggered it can be reached using a normal auto-closing window
* Can now intercept window close attempts when the user clicks X
	* If you don't want "X" to close the window, set enable_close_attempted_event to True when creating window
	* When enabled a WINDOW_CLOSE_ATTEMPTED_EVENT will be returned from read instead of WIN_CLOSED
	* Multiple aliases for the key: WINDOW_CLOSE_ATTEMPTED_EVENT, WIN_X_EVENT, WIN_CLOSE_ATTEMPTED_EVENT
* New Window property - key_dict
	* Returns the "All keys dictionary" which has keys and elements for all elements that have keys specified
* pin helper function got 2 new parameters - expand_x=None, expand_y=None.  Was needed for the Titlebar element
* no_titlebar implementation changed on Linux. Not using "splash" and instead using "dock". Was needed to get the minimize/restore to work
* New set_options parameters in support of custom Titlebar element
	* use_custom_titlebar=None
	* titlebar_background_color=None
	* titlebar_text_color=None
	* titlebar_font=None
	* titlebar_icon=None
* get_globals removed - not required for normal PySimpleGUI.  Was only used by patched packages which will need to fork PySimpleGUI for this feature.
* popup - support for custom titlebar!
* Changed from pathlib to os.path



## 4.34.0 PySimpleGUI 18-Jan-2021

Fix popup_scrolled, big swap of PEP8 names from alias to def statements

* Changed all of the functions and methods so that the definition is PEP8 compliant and and alias is not compliant
* Built-in SDK help
	* Added a "Summary mode"
	* Make window smaller to fit on more monitors
	* Added aliases to end of help for each element
* metadata
	* Changed into a class Property so that it shows up in the docs correctly
	* The Element, Window and SystemTray classes all got this same change
* Added all elements to the docstring for window[key] style lookups to make PyCharm happier
* Moved all PEP8 function aliases to a centralized spot at the end of the code

## 4.38.0 PySimpleGUI 21-Mar-2021

The "so much for no new releases for a while" release

* Changed name of the NEW parm in Multiline element from scrollbar to no_scrollbar

## 4.47.0 PySimpleGUI 30-Aug-2021

Stretch & VStretch - A new era of element alignment!
Upgrade from GitHub - uses pip for real now
Image element - Simpler to use
`size` and `pad` parms can be ints in addition to tuples    to speed up coding

- `rstrip` parm added to `Multiline` element
- `Combo.update` fixed bug added in 4.45.0 with disabled not working correctly when calling update
- Changed font type in all docstrings to be (str or (str, int[, str]) or None) (thank you Jason!!)
- Added code from Jason (slightly modified) for _fixed_map
- Fix for default element size was incorrectly using as the default for parm in Window.
    - Needed to set it in the init code rather than using the parm to set it.
- `Window.location` gets a new parm `more_accurate` (defaults to `False`). If `True`, uses window's geometry
- Added `Window.keep_on_top_set` and `Window.keep_on_top_clear`. Makes window behave like was set when creating Window
- Image Element
	- Added new constant `BLANK_BASE64` that essentially erases an Image element if assigned to it. It's 1x1 pixel and Alpha=0
	- Image element New `source` parameter as the first parm.
		- Can be a string or a bytestring. Backwards compatible because first was filename.
		- Works for both the init and the update. No need to specify any name at all... just pass in the thing you want to change to. Greatly shortens code.
		- Ths idea is to not have to specify the parameter name. `sg.Image('filename')` and `sg.Image(base64)` both work without using any parameter names.
	- Fix for `Image.update` docstring
- Element sizes, when being created, can be an **int**.  If `size=int`, then it represents a `size=(int, 1)`. GREATLY shortens layouts.
	- Sometimes this these things only become apparent later even though it seems obvious
- padding - Another tuple / int convenience change.
	- Tired of typing `pad=(0,0)`?  Yea, me too. Now we can type `pad=0`.
	- If an int is specified instead of a tuple, then a tuple will be created to be same as the int.  `pad=0` is the same as `pad=(0,0)`
- Add NEW upgrade from GitHub code.  Thank you @israel-dryer!
- Change in ttk style naming to ensure more unique style names are used
- Cast key to string when making a ttk style
- Added `"___"` between unique counter and user's key when making a unique style string for ttk widgets. Fixed problem with elements from one window interfering with another window elements
- Changed Upgrade From GitHub Code
	- When upgrading, use the interpreter from the global settings for the upgrade!  This could get tricky, but trying to make it logical
	- Output of the pip command shown in an upgrade window using a `Multiline` element so errors can be copied from it.
	- Added printing of the value of `sys.executable` to the upgrade information
- `Stretch` and `VStretch` Elements - a promising solution to element justification!
	- Redefinition of the `Stretch` element.  No longer returns an Error Element.  It now returns a Text element that does the same kind of operation as the PySimpleGUIQt's `Stretch` element!  Very nice!
    - `VStretch` stretches vertically instead of horizontally
- UserSettings APIs
	- Changed the repr method of the user settings object to use the pretty printer to format the dictionary information into a nicer string


## 4.48.0 PySimpleGUI 25-Sept-2021
- Highlights:
	- Table clicking
	- Push element
	- p = pad in layouts

* Table Element - Feature expansion
    * enable_click_events - New parameter and associated events
	* If parm is True, then events will be generated that are tuples when a user clicks on the table and headers
	* The event format is a tuple: ('-TABLE KEY-', '+CICKED+', (3, 3))  3 items in the tuple:
            1. The Table's key
            2. "An additional event name" in this case I've called it "+CLICKED+"
            3. The (row, col)
	* The (row, col) will match the user's data unless one of these is clicked:
		* A header (will return a row of -1)
		* A row number (these are artificially generated numbers) and has a column of -1
* set_options - new keep_on_top option. Makes all windows you create, including popups, have keep_on_top set to True
* User Settings APIs
    * user_settings_object() - returns the UserSettings object that is used by the function interface for the user_settings APIs
	* Improved print by returning the pprint formattted dictionary rather than just the string version
* Docstrings
    * set_clipboard takes str or bytes
	* ProgressBar - better size parm description
	* Fixed return type for Window.read_all_windows
* ProgressBar - new size_px parameter allows you to specify your meter directly in pixels
* pad alias!  Lazy coders and those wanting ultra-compact layouts may like this one
	* You can use the parameter p just like the parameter pad
    * pad joins the parameters size (s) and key (k)
* Push Element
    * Alias for Stretch - they are the exact same thing
	* Stretch was a term used by Qt.
	* Push "feels" more like what it does.  It "pushes" other elements around
	* Alias is P - like many other Elements, it has a 1-letter alias that can be used to write more compact code
* Removed printing of Mac warnings about global settings at the startup
* Redefined the Debug button to be a simple button with a the graphic as before
* Added a right click menu to the SDK reference so the window can be closed if moved off the screen too far

## 4.49.0 PySimpleGUI 30-Sept-2021

- Highlights
	- popup_get_file bug fix (primary reason for a quick release)
	- VPush
	- popup_get_file fix

- VPush = VP = VStretch
	- Same concept as Push element except in the Vertical direction
- `Image.update_animation_no_buffering` bug fix wasn't checking timer between frames (DOH!)
- `one_line_progress_meter` no longer returns a not OK when max reached.  Makes the user if statements much easier to get only cancel as False
	- Note that this is a backward compatibility problem is you are relying on a False being returned when the counter reaches the maximum
- `popup_get_file` fixed bug when `show_hidden` is set. Added to docstring
- Added `popup_get_file`, get_folder, get_data to the test harness under the popups tab
- Changed docstring for Multiline default value to Any and added a cast to string
- Added more tests and information to the `sg.main()` test harness


## 4.50.0 PySimpleGUI 17-Oct-2021
UserSettings API - support for .INI files
Listbox horizontal scrollbar
Column Element allow None for 1 size direction

* UserSettings API
	* INI File Support
		* Read access:  `settings[section][key]`
	    Modify existing section and key:  `settings[section][key] = new_value`
	    Create a new key in an existing section:  `settings[section][new_key] = new_value`
	    Create a new section and key:  `settings[new_section][new_key] = new_value`
        Delete a section: `settings.delete_section(section)`
        Save the INI file: `settings.save()`
		* Available for UserSettings object only, not the function interface
		* Demo Program released specific to .ini features
		* Option to convert strings to Python values for True, False, None
	* Added checks for running on Trinket or Replit so path can be set to "." if on either
* Added `running_replit` function. Returns True if environment is repl.it
* New option in set_options - `warn_button_key_duplicates` will show a warning if duplicate keys found on buttons. Defaults to OFF (duplicate key attempts on Buttons are common and OK)
* Right Click Menus
	* New Element method `Element.set_right_click_menu`
		* Enables changing a right click menu after initial window is created
		* If none specified, uses the parent's menu
* Added `Window.get_size_accurate()` to get the window's size based on the geometry string from tkinter
* Removed moving of the theme color swatch preview window and allowed to center now
* Added check for bad value returned from tkinter when table clicked event happens
* Removed print when 8.6.9 ttk treeview code is patched
* Removed a debug print accidentally left in the bind code
* Listbox - added horizontal scrollbar option
* New `pin` layout helper function implementation (hopefully better, not worse)
* Column Element - Allow `None` to be used in any part of the `size`.
	* If None used on width, then Column will default to width required by contents.
	* If None used on height, then Column will default to width required by contents divided by 2
	* These are same values as `(None, None)` today but can invidually control now.
* Made `Window.LayoutAndRead` deprication more user friendly with a popup
* Added * to the `file_types` default so that files without an extension are shown (only a problem on non-Windows systems). Default is now `(("ALL Files", "*.* *"),)`
	* Changed `popup_get_file`, the Browse buttons, etc
	* `FILE_TYPES_ALL_FILES` is a new constant with this value
* `popup_scrolled` added 1 line per argument to fit the contents better in some cases


## 4.51.0 PySimpleGUI 18-Oct-2021
`relative_location` parameter for `Window`

* New parameter for `Window` - `relative_location`
	* Locates the window at an **offset** from the normal location
	* Very useful for multi-window applications
	* Also works when you've set a default window location using the `set_options` call.

## 4.51.2 - 4.51.7

A series of dot releases to make the psg commands operational for upgrading, etc.  Was a bit of a mess for a week

## 4.52.0 - A deleted release that instead fell back to 4.51.* dot releases

## 4.53.0 PySimpleGUI 24-Oct-2021

The "Mike's really excited about this release!" release

psg commands!
psgmain
psgupgrade
psghelp
psgver
psgsettings
Control Click window movement
Frame Elements with `size` parameter

I really like this release.  It pulls together a ***lot*** of work over the past week. It fixes some things that have bothered me for a long time and adds support for some things that have bothered users for a long time.... so here we go....


* Added Commands that you can type or make shortcuts to
	* psgmain - Runs the sg.main() test harness.  Your gateway to settings, version info, etc
	* psgupgrade - Upgrades PySimpleGUI to the latest version on ***GitHub***
	* psghelp - view the SDK help window
	* psgver - view the version numbers
	* psgsettings - access the settings window (usually done via the main window)
	* Don't forget to use `sudo` if you're upgrading on Linux!
* Control Key Dragging - move ***any*** PySimpleGUI window by holding down control key while holding the left mouse button down. Ignores the usual Grab Anywhere restrictions and allows dragging over Multiline elements for example
* A new, shorter, version of the 1x1 pixel BLANK_BASE64 image
* Image Element
	* New logic for the `Image.update()` (with no parms). This will delete an image and now will also shrink down to 1 pixel
	* Set border width to 0 so that takes up even less space when empty
* Frame Element
	* Can now use the `size` parameter to create a fixed size Frame
	* `element_justification` behaves properly - consider using a `Frame` with border width=0 and no text instead of a `Column` element if you need both a hard coded size and to justify the elements inside
* `set_options`
	* Added `dpi_awareness` setting to turn on DPI Awareness (currently only on Windows)
	* Added `scaling` parameter for system-wide Window scaling
* `Window`
	* Added `scaling` parameter - will scale the contents of the window. Takes a float value
	* If need scaling for **all windows** then set using the `set_options` call
* Better 3.4 compatibility
	* Previously has issues with subprocesses
	* Upgrade to GitHub version now works
	* The new psgcommands to work too so all you 3.4, 3.5 users out there aren't left behind!
	* The PySimpleGUI Tent was built to be big and has plans on staying that way
* Exec APIs - improved ability to modify interpreter to use in other programs so that your program will then pick up the latest changes
* Testing more thoroughly 3.4, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10 and tkinter 8.6.2 through 8.6.10
* Doc updates to the Call Reference doc - Added `Sizer` element and reorganizing a bit.
* Special thanks to Jason for providing amazing support to the PySimpleGUI users. If you think PySimpleGUI is great... if you really want to see something impressive, try logging an issue on the GitHub and watch Jason do his thing.

## 4.54.0 PySimpleGUI 6-Nov-2021

Tabs - Are even better now
Right click menu better for Tabs, Frame, Columns
relative_location proliferation

* Tab & TabGroup
	* Added image_source parameter, enabling file-based and Base64 images to be added to your tabs
	* image_subample parm added so images and be reduced in size
	* TabGroup.add_tab also got the image support
	* tab_border_width parm added to TabGroup to control the border around the tab labels
	* Added constants for Tab Location for easier code completion. All begin with TAB_LOCATION_
	* focus_color added to TabGroup
	* Significant change to right-click menus for Tabs. Now the Tab determines the right click menu shown when right clicking a tab title. Enables a right-click to close feature.
* Frame Element
	* Better right click support in blank areas
	* Added grab parameter
	* Btter grab support in blank areas
* VerticalSeperator - Improvement in expansion
* VPush and Push - background_color parameter added
* grab_any_where_on - unreported bug fixed
* relative_location - a recent parameter to Window has been added to all popups and to Print
* New Base64 images
	* Hearts (TWO types), green checkmark, red X
		* HEART_3D_BASE64
		* HEART_FLAT_BASE64
		* GREEN_CHECK_BASE64
		* RED_X_BASE64
	* Each are 90 x 90 pixels
	* Use image_subsample to reduce size to 45, 30, etc
* bar_color added to ProgressMeter.update
* visible parm added to all pre-defined buttons (FileBrowse, FolderBrowse, Ok, Cancel, etc)
* Exec APIs stderr merge with stdout
	* merge_stderr_with_stdout added to execute_command_subprocess and execute_py_file
	* Default it TRUE
	* Stderr will be merged with stdout in 1 stream
* Right click menus propagate down the container elements (Column, Frame, Tab) to the elements inside
* Window.mouse_location() - returns tuple with mouse (x,y) location
* SDK Help window now resizble
* MENU_RIGHT_CLICK_DISABLED changed to match format of normal right click menus
* psgmain and psgupgrade - changed version of Python used to relaunch to be the same as the one calling the function to invoke PySimpleGUI. Also changed the upgrade from GitHub logic to use Python interpreter for pip as used to invoke.


## 4.55.0 PySimpleGUI 7-Nov-2021

Exec APIs - Use sys.executable as default
FIXED the install from GitHub problem with psgmain/psgupgrade!

* Exec APIs Changes
	* If no interpreter is set in the global settings, then the interpreter running currently (sys.executable) will be used as the default rather than the system-wide default.
	* Use python NOT pythonw (if returned from sys.executable) for all upgrades from github. The pip command was running pythonw and that caused future psgmain, psgupgrade, etc, commands to fail


## 4.55.1 PySimpleGUI 7-Nov-2021

* Exec API Fix
	* Fix for bug created in 4.55.0 that caused the Global Setting for Python interpreter to never be used
	* The sys.executable interpreter will be used for GitHub upgrades and if no interpreter is specified in the PySimpleGUI settings



## 4.56.0 PySimpleGUI 5-Jan-2022

The "It's been a minute" & "Welcome to 2022!" release


* Addition of stdin parm to execute_command_subprocess. This is to fix problem when pyinstaller is used to make an EXE from a psg program that calls this function
* Changed getargspec call in the SDK Reference window to getfullargspec. In 3.11 getargspec is no longer supported and thus crashes
* Added try to SDK Reference event loop to catch any additional problems that may pop up in 3.11
* Added Window.move_to_center moves a window to the center of the screen. Good for when your window changes size or you want to recenter it
* Disable debugger when installing from github
* Better error reporting when a problem with the layout detected
* Removed import of site and now get the information from os.path.dirname(sys.executable).  I like simpler!
* Combo added parameters to control the colors on the button used to display the items. Parms are button_background_color and button_arrow_color
    * Default values continue to be the same the theme's button color if nothing is set.
* Fixed missing docstring item for Table value so that the new documentation will be accurate
* (Maybe temporarily) added print to the Text element. Was an easy addition, but is limited in how colors are controlled, scrolling, etc.  May be very short-lived addition.
* New Table Element parameter right_click_selects. Default is False. If True, then will select a row using the right mouse button, but only if
    * zero or one rows are selected. If multiple rows are already selected, then the right click will not change the selection. This feature enables
    * a right-click-menu to be combined with table selection for features such as "delete row" using a right click menu.
* Fixed bug in Column element was incorrectly checking background color for None or COLOR_SYSTEM_DEFAULT
* Changed docstring for Table.get_last_clicked_postition to indicate what's returned now. Was not useful for tkinter port until recently when cell clicks added.
* Better auto-sizing of Columns for Tables.
    * Better sizing of the row number column using the font for the header in the calculation
    * Use the column heading font to help determine if the header will be what determines the width instead of the data in the column
* Don't print the error message about wm_overrideredirect while hiding the master root if running on a Mac.
* Fix for Tree Element not setting the row height if none is specified. Needed to set to value based on the font used.
* Tree Element
    * Always left justify the first column. This is how it's always worked. tkinter 8.6.12 changed the behavior of the first col. This changes it back
    * Better auto-size column. Uses the data as well as the Column header to determine size of column
* Table Element fix case when tables have too many headers, thus not matching the data columns
* Tree element addition of a heading for the Column 0 (the main column shown in the Tree). Default is '' which is what's shown today.
* Graph Element Experimental addition of parm motion_events If True then mouse motion over the Graph returns event of key '+MOVE' or (key, '+MOVE')
* ButtonMenu Element
    * New init parm image_source Use instead of the filename and data parms. This parm is a unified one and is how several other elements work now too.
    * New update parms image_source, image_size, image_subsample enables the initial image to be changed to a new one
* Fix in sdk_help crashed if asked for summary view of Titlebar or MenubarCustom because they're not classes
* Fix in open github issue the python experience and overall experience values were swapped.
* UserSettings delete_entry will show popup error now with traceback like almost all PySimpleGUI errors (can be silenced)
* TTK Button wraplen fix, height padding fix? (thank you Jason for another fix!)
* Button fix for wraplen on non-TTK buttons.
* Layout reuse error message
* Fix for set_options checking for "not None" instead of "True" for the dpi_awareness setting.  Note that once turned on, there is no option to turn off.
* Docstring changes for all Element.update methods to indicate that the change will not be visible until Window.refresh or Window.read is called
* Enabled the Text class methods that measure strings and characters to be called prior to any windows being created. Method list:
    * string_width_in_pixels, char_height_in_pixels, char_width_in_pixels
    * Replaced the error messages that were being printed with a poper error popup
* Removed destruction of hidden master root from popup_get_file and popup_get_folder



## 4.57.0 PySimpleGUI 13-Feb 2022

A little of this, a little of that
New Emojis for 2022... collect them all!


- set_options added disable_modal_windows option to provide a single call to disable the modal feature globally (including popups)
- Added OptionMenu to the list of tkinter widgets that are ignored when the grab anywhere feature is used
- Slider update the range FIRST and then the value in the update method (thank you Jason for the fix)
- Updated docstrings for all Element.update methods to indicate that the helper function "pin" need to be used to keep an element in place if visibility changes
- Replaced sponsor tab with a tab about the udemy course as well as the buy me a coffee link
- Fixed event generation for Spin element.  Also changed to use the "command" parameter to get the event. NOTE still need to handle manual entry
- New Emojis for 2022!
- New base64 image PYTHON_COLORED_HEARTS_BASE64 (yes, more hearts... apologies to the heart-haters)
- Changed +CICKEDto +CLICKED(typo) in the table header
- Added constant TABLE_CLICKED_INDICATOR that is the value '+CLICKED+' so that it can be referenced instead of user's hard cording a string
- Added class method Text.fonts_installed_list returns list of fonts as reported by tkinter
- Horizontal scrollbar for Multiline element (long awaited).  New parameter added to control just this one scrollbar. The no_scrollbar existing parm refers to the vertical scrollbar
- Fix for font parameter only being applied to Text portion of popup_get_text. Should have been to the entire window.
- Updated the internal keys to use the -KEY- coding convention. Was using the really old _KEY_ coding convention.
- Added check for bad Image filename in Image.update. Will show an error popup now like the initial Image element creation error popup
- Addition of parameter paste (bool) to Input.update.  Inserts as if the value was pasted rather than replacing entirely
- Fix for Listbox scrollbar not behaving correctly when making element invisible / visible
- Docstring update for Window.perform_long_operation warns users that Thread are used and thus no PySimpleGUI calls are allowed. Also added description of exactly what happens when the user's function completes.

## 4.58.0 PySimpleGUI 3-Apr-2022

A little of this and that release
More focus on focus
`bind` methods improved with `propagate` parm
Visibility losing settings fix

- `execute_get_results` Added checking for timeout error to  instead of showing an error popup as it's not truly an error in this case
- `Checkbox` Added cast to bool of default parm in case user passes in an incorrect type
- `ButtonMenu.update` addition of button_text parameter. Enables changing text displayed on the ButtonMenu. Should have been an original feature.
- Open GitHub Issue GUI Tabs use 2 lines now. Added tab asking where found PSG.
- New symbols `SYMBOL_CHECKMARK_SMALL` & `SYMBOL_X_SMALL`
- `ButtonMenu.Click` - Added click PEP8 alias `ButtonMenu.click`
- Automatically add timeouts to user reads if a debugger window is opened. Debugger for multi-window applications still needs to be added
- `Window.start_thread` a simple alias for `Window.perform_long_operation`.  It's clearer what's happening with this alias.
- `bind_return_key` parm added to Spin element.  If element has focus and the return key is pressed, then an event is generated.
- Event generation for disabled elements
	- If an element is disabled, then don't generate events (fixed specifically for Input element). However, if a Browse button fills in a disabled element, then an event should still be generated
	- Don't generate events if no files / folders selected using File or Folder Browse buttons. If cancel is clicked then no longer generates an event.
- Fix docstring for image in the Titlebar element. Incorrectly said an ICO file can be used. Must be PNG or GIF
- Windows-specific code that enables the PySimpleGUI supplied icon to be shown rather than the python.exe logo
- Removed all temporary Tk() window creation calls
	- Instead create the hidden master root.
	- These were required for operations like getting the list of fonts from tkinter, the screensize, character width and height. This way one and only one Tk window will ever be creeated
	- The reason for the change is that the Mac crashes if multiple Tk() objects are created, even if only 1 at a time is active.
- `image_source` parm added to `Button`
	- It can be either a filename or a base64 string.
	- This is like the Image elements parms
- Graph element doc string improvement. Describes the mouse up event.
- Improved support for focus
	- `Element.get_next_focus` added. Returns the element that should get the focus after the indicated element
	- `Element.get_previous_focus` added. Returns the element that should get the focus after the indicated element
	- Better exception error reporting for the Element focus methods.  Uses popups with tracebacks now instead of prints
- `Window.widget_to_element` returns the element that a tkinter widget is used to implement (it's a reverse lookup)
- `Element.widget` added.  It's a PEP8 compliant property  that returns `Element.Widget`
- `Element.key` added. It's a PEP8 compliant property that returns `Element.Key`
- Simplified Radio, Checkbox, Slider creation. Moved the command parm outside the creation and instead made a config call.
- Visibility fix
	- Expand and other settings were being lost when element is made invisible and visible again.
- `propagate` parameter to the bind methods.  Used to tell tkinter whether or not to propagate the event to the element / or window
- `Canvas.update` method added so that a `Canvas` can be made visible/invisible
- Removed the need for `tk.scrolledtext.ScrolledText` by adding a vertical scrollbar to a Text widget.  Getting ready for addition of ttk scrollbars!
- `tooltip_offset` parm added to `set_options` as a way to set tooltip location (a hack to get around an 8.6.12 bug)
- `Table` and `Tree` elements new parameters
	- `border_width` -  the border width for the element
	- `header_border_width` - the width of the border for the header
	- `header_relief` - the type of header relief to use
- `Table` and `Tree` elements are now excluded from grab-anywhere so that headers can be resized without moving the window

## 4.59.0 PySimpleGUI 4-Apr-2022

An oh sh*t release due to yesterday's bug
New force modal Windows option
Test harness forces all windows to be modal and is no longer keep-on-top

- Removed ttk theme from the test harness. Forgot that I had changed it for testing.
- Fixed bug where disabled state was not correctly saved in update methods, causing events to not be generated (Thank you Jason, again!)
	- Changed numerous elements, not just the `Input` element that demonstrated the problem
- New `force_modal_windows` parm added to `set_options`
	- Forces all windows to be modal
	- Overrides the `disable_modal_windows` option
	- Used in the `main()` test harness to ensure all windows are modal so no window is accidentally lost
- Test Harness changes
	- Set `keep_on_top=True` for all popups and windows created by test harness
	- Set the main window `keep_on_top=False`. Ensures that all windows created by it should never be hidden.  This is a somewhat experimental change.  Let's hope for the best!
	- Forced all windows except for 1 non-modal popup to be modal. This also should ensure no windows are "lost" behind the main window


## 4.60.0 PySimpleGUI 8-May-2022

TTK Scrollbars... the carpet now matches the drapes
Debug Window improvements
Built-in Screen-capture Initial Release
Test Harness and Settings Windows fit on small screens better

* Debug Window
	* Added the `wait` and `blocking` parameters (they are identical)
		* Setting to `True` will make the `Print` call wait for a user to press a `Click To Continue...` button
		* Example use - if you want to print right before exiting your program
	* Added `Pause` button
		* If clicked, the `Print` will not return until user presses `Resume`
		* Good for programs that are outputting information quickly and you want to pause execution so you can read the output
* TTK
	* TTK Theme added to the PySimpleGUI Global Settings Window
	* Theme list is retrieved from tkinter now rather than hard coded
	* TTK Scrollbars
		* All Scrollbars have been replaced with TTK Scrollbars
		* Scrollbars now match the PySimpleGUI theme colors
		* Can indicate default settings in the PySimpleGUI Global Settings Window
		* Can preview the settings in the Global Settings Window
		* Scrollbars settings are defined in this priority order:
			* The Element's creation in your layout
			* The Window's creation
			* Calling `set_options`
			* The defaults in the PySimpleGUI Global Settings
		* The TTK Theme can change the appearance of scrollbars as well
		* Impacted Elements:
			* `Multiline`
			* `Listbox`
			* `Table`
			* `Tree`
			* `Output`
 * Tree Element gets horizontal scrollbar setting
 * `sg.main()` Test Harness
 	* Restructured the `main()` Test Harness to be more compact. Now fits Pi screens better.
 	* Made not modal so can interact with the Debug Window
 	* Turned off Grab Anywhere (note you can always use Control+Drag to move any PySimpleGUI window)
 	* Freed up graph lines as they scroll off the screen for better memory management
 	* Made the upgrade from GitHub status window smaller to fit small screens better
 * Global Settings
 	* Restructured the Global Settings window to be tabbed
 	* Added ability to control Custom Titlebar. Set here and all of your applications will use this setting for the Titlebar and Menubar
 	* TTK Theme can be specified in the global settings (already mentioned above)
 	* New section for the Screenshot feature
 * Exception handling added to `bind` methods
 * Screenshots
	 * First / early release of a built-in screenshot feature
	 * Requires that PIL be installed on your system
	 * New `Window` method `save_window_screenshot_to_disk`
	 * Global Settings allows definition of a hotkey that triggers a save
	 * Popup is shown when hotkeys are used
	 * **To be clear** - PIL does not need to be installed in order to use PySimpleGUI.  ONLY when a capture is attempted does PySimpleGUI try to import PIL
	 * It's the first step of building the larger "Gallery" feature
	 * The alignment is not perfect and  the whole thing needs more work
	 * The auto-numbering freature is not yet implemented.  Only 1 file is used and is overwritten if exists
* `user_settings_delete_filename` got a new parm `report_error` (off by default).  The `UserSettings` object also got this parm to help control error reporting
* Themes (PySimpleGUI Themes)
	* `theme_global` - added error checking and reporting should non-strandard theme names be attempted with this call
	* New theme `Dark Grey 15`.  Give it a try!
	* New theme `Python Plus` - a more saturated blue and yellow colors. Give it a try!
	* New function - `theme_button_color_background` - read-only call that returns the button background color. Previously only available as a tuple using `theme_button_color`.
	* New function - `theme_button_color_text` - read-only call that returns the button text color. Previously only available as a tuple using `theme_button_color`.
	* New function - `theme_use_custom_titlebar` returns `True` if Global Settings indicate custom titlebars should will be used
* `Output` Element - implementation changed to use the Multiline Element.  No one should be impacted unless you were using some internal object details that was not published.  I still suggest using the `Multiline` element instead so that you can access much more functionality.
* Tab errors now use the popup errors with traceback
* `Column` Element
	* Fixed scrollwheel not working correctly when expand parameters used. Scrolls the canvas now not the frame.
	* New `size_subsample_width` & `size_subsample_height` parameteres
		* Gives much more control over the sizing of SCROLLABLE columns.  Previously the size was set to 1/2 the required height and the full required width.
		* The defaults are backward compatible (size_subsample_width=1, size_subsample_height=2)
		* Setting both to 1 will make the Column fit the contents exactly. One use is when you expect your Column to grow or shrink over time.  Or maybe you didn't like the 1/2 size that PySimpleGUI has always used before.
* Made Select Colors match the theme colors
	* `Input`, `Multiline`, `Combo` elements now use matching colors for selections of characters (big-time thanks to Jason who also provided the magic code to make the combo drop-down match the theme)
* `popup_get_file` - Removed the file_types parameter use if on a Mac
	* Missed catching this problem when added the no_window option
	* Need to revisit this file types on the Mac topic in next release.
	* Particularly bad problem because cannot catch the exception.  Your code simply crashes.  And the behavior isn't the same across all Macs.
	* I'm really sorry Mac users that we keep running into these kinds of issues!
* Auto-correct file_types problems for Browse buttons.  Automatically change the formatting from (str, str) to ((str, str),) and warns the user
* Docstring typo fixes for file_types parm

## 4.60.1 PySimpleGUI 22-May-2022

* A patch-release that fixes crash if `horizontal_scrollbar=True` when making a `Listbox` element


## 4.60.2 PySimpleGUI 26-Jul-2022

* Emergency Patch Release for Mac OS 12.3 and greater
	* Adds a PySimpleGUI Mac Control Panel Controlled patch that sets the Alpha channel to 0.99 by default for these users
	* Is a workaround for a bug that was introduced into Mac OS 12.3

* Added Intelligent Upgrade Service -  inform users when there are releases of PySimpleGUI that fix a problem that may be unique to their combination of components
* Change to GitHub Issue GUI
	* Added checkbox for checking if running latest PyPI version
	* Recommended using Demo Browser to search Demo Programs
	* Use platform module to fill in the OS information field
* SDK Help Window - changed all readthedocs links to use the PySimpleGUI.org hostname for better portability




## Code Condition

    Make it run
    Make it right
    Make it fast

It's a recipe for success if done right.  PySimpleGUI has completed the "Make it run" phase.  It's far from "right" in many ways.  These are being worked on.  The module has historically been particularly poor for PEP8 compliance.  It was a learning exercise that turned into a somewhat complete GUI solution for lightweight problems.

While the internals to PySimpleGUI are a tad sketchy, the public interfaces into the SDK are more strictly defined and comply with PEP8 naming conventions.  A set of "PEP8 Bindings" was released in summer of 2019 to ensure the externally facing interfaces all adhere to PEP8 names.

Please log bugs and suggestions **only on the PySimpleGUI GitHub**!  It will only make the code stronger and better in the end, a good thing for us all, right?  Logging them elsewhere doesn't enable the core developer and other PySimpleGUI users to help.  To make matters worse, you may get bad advice from other sites because there are simply not many PySimpleGUI experts, yet.

## Design

A moment about the design-spirit of `PySimpleGUI`.  From the beginning, this package was meant to take advantage of Python's capabilities with the goal of programming ease.

**Single File**
While not the best programming practice, the implementation resulted in a single file solution.  Only one file is needed, PySimpleGUI.py.  You can post this file, email it, and easily import it using one statement.

**Functions as objects**
In Python, functions behave just like object. When you're placing a Text Element into your form, you may be sometimes calling a function and other times declaring an object.  If you use the word Text, then you're getting an object.  If you're using `Txt`, then you're calling a function that returns a `Text` object.

**Lists**
It seemed quite natural to use Python's powerful list constructs when possible.  The form is specified as a series of lists.  Each "row" of the GUI is represented as a list of Elements.

**Dictionaries**
Want to view your form's results as a dictionary instead of a list... no problem, just use the `key` keyword on your elements.  For complex forms with a lot of values that need to be changed frequently, this is by far the best way of consuming the results.

You can also look up elements using their keys.  This is an excellent way to update elements in reaction to another element.  Call `form.FindElement(key)` to get the Element.

**Named / Optional Parameters**
This is a language feature that is featured **heavily**  in all of the API calls, both functions and classes.  Elements are configured, in-place, by setting one or more optional parameters.  For example, a Text element's color is chosen by setting the optional `text_color` parameter.

**tkinter**
tkinter is the "official" GUI that Python supports.  It runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac.  It was chosen as the first target GUI framework due to its ***ubiquity***.  Nearly all Python installations, with the exception of Ubuntu Linux, come pre-loaded with tkinter.   It is the "simplest" of the GUI frameworks to get up an running (among Qt, WxPython, Kivy, etc).

From the start of the PSG project, tkinter was not meant to be the only underlying GUI framework for PySimpleGUI.  It is merely a starting point.  All journeys begin with one step forward and choosing tkinter was the first of many steps for PySimpleGUI.  Now there are 4 ports up and running - tkinter, WxPython, Qt and Remi (web support)

## Acknowledgments

There are a number of people that have been key contributors to this project both directly and indirectly.  Paid professional help has been deployed a number of critical times in the project's history.  This happens in the life of software development from time to time.

If you've helped, I sure hope that you feel like you've been properly thanked.  That you have been recognized.  If not, then say something.... drop an email to comments@PySimpleGUI.org.
Please see the readme file for usage of other Python packages by this project.

## Support

In response to a number of email contacts from individuals and corporations that are using PySimpleGUI that wanted to financially support the project a "Support" Button was added to the GitHub site.  This support button is connected with a PayPal account.  If you wish to help support this currently freely supplied software and free technical support, then follow this link: https://www.paypal.me/pythongui.  You'll find all the ways you can help support PySimpleGUI in the readme.

The project is self-funded and there are ongoing costs just to offer the software (URLs, ReadTheDocs, etc). If you're a corporate user and find that PySimpleGUI is helping you financially, that's awesome.  If you want to help ensure PySimpleGUI has a future, you now have that option to help.  It's likely that at some point the costs will become too high for the project to continue to be free or perhaps continue at all, but until then we'll all enjoy the successes we're having.
