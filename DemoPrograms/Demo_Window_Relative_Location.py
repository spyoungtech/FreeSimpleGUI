    Demo - Relative Location

    How to create a window at a location relative to where it would normally be placed.

    Normally, by default, windows are centered on the screen.
    Other ways initial window position is determined:
    1. You can also specify the location when creating it by using the location parameter
    2. You can use set_options to set the location all windows will be created

    This demo shows how to use the parameter to Window called relative_location.

    As the name suggests, it is a position relative to where it would normally be created.

    Both positive and negative values are valid.
        relative_location=(0, -150) will create the window UP 150 pixels from where it would normally be created
